        <h1>Welcome to Three Count Records!</h1>   
            <h2>
                Our Story
            </h2>
                <p>
                    Three Count Records is a mobile record store and podcasting studio. TCR started off with a question. How could three friends turn their love of music, pro-wrestling, storytelling, and community into something they could share with the world? Our dream is to bring fantastic vinyl tunes across the piedmont of North Carolina. Along the way, we want to capture the stories of the people we meet and share them with the world. If you're into music, wrasslin', or storytelling, give us a shout!
                </p>

                <h3>
                    AJ (The PunkBandit)
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        AJ is a veteran educator, music fiend, husband, dad, and all-around fantastic friend. He has been teaching in North Carolina since 2006. You've never met an elementary school teacher with half-sleeve tattoos, foot-long beard, and sometimes sports a mohawk? Well then you never had the joy of being in AJ's class. You'll never meet a better friend or cooler person. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        AJ is an encyclopaedia of musical knowledge. His go to tunes are punk rock, ska, 60s garage rock, rockabilly, and anything else you can play really loud. 
                    </p>
                <h3>
                    Philip (P-H-D)
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        Philip is larger than life and a natural story teller. As noted in his byline, Philip has a PhD in Spanish Literature. He's obviously way too qualified for this gig. Philip is a husband, dad, friend, former teacher, and current podcaster. You can check out his work on the Stokes County Boys podcast. Philip is known to dance like Mick Jagger when he gets excited. He is also our resident WCW/Jim Crocket Promotions expert.

                    <p>
                        The Good Doctor loves punk rock, ska, all things Dio, and soul. He's also a fantastic guitarist/vocalist. Check back and maybe we will link some grainy footage circa 2009!

                <h3>
                    Zach (The Sugarbear)
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        Zach is a veteran educator, Oasis superstan, husband, dad, and tech enthusiast. He has been teaching in North Carolina since 2008. Zach is obsessed with the Black and Gold era of NXT. He's all about the journey and friendship that Three Count Records promises.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Zach listens to pretty much anything. He loves punk rock, Oasis, hip-hop (1995-2010), bluegrass, old-school country, and a lot more. He is also responsible for all of the mistakes on this DIY website.
